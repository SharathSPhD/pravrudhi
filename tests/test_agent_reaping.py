"""A dispatched agent must not outlive its dispatch.

A coding-agent CLI is a launcher: it spawns a sandbox helper which spawns the work. Killing only the direct child
leaves the grandchildren alive, still talking to the provider and still billing. Eight such orphans were found
running at once on this machine, the oldest three hours after its task had returned a verdict and had its work
merged, and nothing in any log distinguished a finished dispatch from a still-running agent.
