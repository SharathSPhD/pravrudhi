"""The coding-agent extension point: one protocol, many providers.

Pravrudhi's `Target` protocol is how a *benchmark* plugs in. This is the other side: how an external coding agent
(Claude Code, Codex, an Orca-managed agent, a local model) plugs in as a proposer of code changes to the harness and
the engine. The controller stays provider-neutral, so no single vendor or orchestrator is load-bearing.

Two boundaries are enforced here rather than left to good intentions.

Protected paths: an external agent works in its own git worktree and may not touch the kernel, the ledger, the sealed
pools or the pre-registration thresholds. Those are the tamper surfaces of a self-grading system, and an agent that
edits its own evaluator is not improving, it is cheating. `Diff.violations` names any protected path a run touched.

Distillation: these agents write code. Weight-level distillation teachers are open-weight local models (Qwen today).
A hosted assistant's outputs must never become training data for a trainee, which is both a licence question and a
scientific one, since a distilled trainee would no longer be measuring the loop.
