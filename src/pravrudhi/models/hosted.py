"""Hosted free-tier models, for the operator's own engine only.

The proposer and the chat surface have been running against a local GGUF server, which holds the GPU the trainee
needs and is too small to drive a tool-calling loop reliably. A hosted free-tier endpoint solves both, but it
belongs to whoever owns the API key, so it must never become a default that a stranger's installation picks up:
an engine someone else installs has no key, and if it somehow had one it would be spending the operator's quota.

Two gates, and both must pass. The key is read only from the operator's own owner-only file by the shared
`free-tier-llm` client, so it is absent by construction on any other machine. And the surface is refused unless
the operator has explicitly opted in AND, when identity is switched on, the caller is the configured admin.
Neither gate is on by default, and nothing here is packaged into the wheel's runtime path.
