"""Memory: what belongs to the user, kept apart from what the ledger already owns.

Until this module existed, anything a user told the assistant about themselves — their preferred base model, a
constraint they mentioned once, the fact that this workspace is for a legal-domain LoRA rather than a generic one —
lived nowhere and was re-derived, or forgotten, at the start of every session. There was also no place to put a
conversation: chat had to be stateless or it had to borrow the ledger, and the ledger is the wrong place for it. The
kernel's evidence is append-only and immutable by design (`docs/blueprint/02-design/08-memory-and-context.md` §1-2;
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-pravrudhi-multitenant-design.md` §5); a store for preferences, notes and chat
threads must never be confused with it, because if the ledger is later repaired (a signoff withdrawn, a candidate
resealed) a memory that duplicated a ledger number would now be false and would contradict the source of truth. This
module holds only what genuinely is not evidence: what the user asked to be remembered, what they set, and what they
said.

Three kinds live here, each a frozen dataclass with its own typed store: `Preference` (a key/value the user set, with
provenance of when and how); `MemoryNote` (a durable fact the user asked to remember, or the assistant recorded with
the user's assent — never a benchmark number, see `remember`); and `ChatTurn`/`ChatThread` (conversation history,
scoped to a thread). Storage is JSON lines under `<workspace>/.pravrudhi/memory/`, one file per kind, the same
per-workspace addressing `objectives.py` uses for objectives.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-pravrudhi-memory-design.md.
