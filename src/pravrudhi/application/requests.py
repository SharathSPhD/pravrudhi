"""What the operator actually asked for, kept where it cannot be quietly forgotten.

An ask arrives in conversation and lives only in a transcript. Work drifts towards what is easy, a later session
inherits no record of what was wanted, and the operator has to notice the omission himself and say it twice. This
module makes the ask a first-class object: captured verbatim with its date, broken into criteria that can each be
checked, and closable only against evidence.

Two rules give it teeth, both chosen by the operator on 2026-09-06.

The first is that a request cannot be marked delivered by assertion. `deliver` refuses unless every acceptance
criterion carries evidence — a commit, a ledger sequence, a file, or a command whose output was seen. Saying a
thing is done is not evidence that it is.

The second is that an unaddressed request gets louder. `staleness` grows with the days a captured request has sat
untouched, and `next_unmet` hands the heartbeat the one that has waited longest, so the loop works the backlog
without being asked to.

Nothing here interprets the operator. The verbatim text is stored unmodified and every criterion records who
wrote it, so a criterion invented by the engine can never be mistaken for something the operator said.
