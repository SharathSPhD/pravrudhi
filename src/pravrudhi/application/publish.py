"""Put what the engine has done in front of the operator, without anyone remembering to do it.

Every visible failure in this project's first day had the same shape: work was finished, tested and committed, and
the operator still could not see it. A page shipped before the recorded snapshot carried its data, so it rendered
"this recording predates..." on the public site while working perfectly against a live engine. A base path was
wrong, so the identical build worked on one host and failed on the other. A commit sat unpushed, so the deployment
that rebuilds on push never ran.

So publishing is one operation with a fixed order, and each step is a precondition of the next:

    export the snapshot -> build the interface -> verify the pages render -> commit -> push

The order matters. Exporting after building leaves the built bundle carrying yesterday's data. Committing before
verifying publishes a page that answers 200 and shows an error. Pushing is last because it is the only step that
reaches other people.

`publish` refuses rather than half-completes: a failing build, a page that renders an error, or a dirty tree
carrying files it was not asked to commit all stop it with a reason. Nothing here forces anything.
