"""Delegating development work to the agent fleet, safely.

Several agents improving one repository is useful only if their work cannot collide or slip in unvalidated. Three
guarantees are enforced here rather than trusted to the agents or to whoever wrote the prompt.

Disjoint ownership: a task declares the paths it may touch, and two tasks that could touch the same path are never
dispatched together. Agents cannot overwrite each other because they are never given overlapping ground, and each
works in its own worktree besides.

Declared scope: after the run the diff is checked against the declaration. An agent that edited something it was
not given is rejected whole, not partially merged, because a diff that wandered is evidence the agent misunderstood
the task rather than a diff with one stray file in it.

Validation before merge: the task's own check runs inside the worktree, and only a passing, in-scope,
protected-path-clean diff is eligible. Nothing reaches the working tree because an agent said it was finished.
