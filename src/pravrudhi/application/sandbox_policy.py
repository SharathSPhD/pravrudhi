"""A sandboxed subagent's policy was assembled by hand, once, at the one call site that needed it.

`subagents.tasks_from_plan` builds a `TaskSpec` per step by writing out an `allowed_paths` tuple and a `validate`
shell command inline; that was the whole of what "this task runs under a policy" meant. NemoClaw's OpenShell
sandboxes make the same idea -- an explicit, named policy of what a sandbox may touch and call -- a declared
object instead of scattered call-site logic: a policy names allowed and denied paths, a network posture, a set
of permitted tools, and a wall-clock budget, and a sandbox is handed one of these by name rather than having its
scope re-derived every time it is dispatched.

This module is that vocabulary for Pravrudhi, borrowed rather than copied: `Policy` is the declared object,
`sandbox_policies.yaml` is where the presets are named, and `apply_policy` is how a `TaskSpec` is narrowed to
fit one before dispatch. Nothing here dispatches a task or edits `application/subagents.py`; the wiring between
a proposal's plan and a named policy is a separate change.
