"""A conversation with the engine that cannot quote a number the engine did not just look up.

Every other surface in this codebase reaches its numbers by replaying the ledger: `objectives.progress`
recomputes a delta from external-eval rows on every call, and `evidence.py` renders documents straight from
those rows. A chat surface breaks that discipline in a way no other screen can, because the thing composing
the sentence is a language model: it will happily write "the harness improved by 4.8 points" whether or not
any row says so, and the sentence is indistinguishable from a true one. A screen that renders a stored number
can at least be traced to the store. A model's prose has no store behind it at all.

So the model here is never trusted with arithmetic or recall. It may only ask for tools, and the tools are
the same replay functions the rest of the engine uses. After the model has written its draft, `converse`
runs a final pass that deletes every sentence containing a numeral no tool returned this turn, and reports
each deletion under `refusals` with the sentence it came from. The guarantee therefore does not depend on
the model cooperating, on a system prompt being obeyed, or on a particular model being used: a number that
no tool produced cannot reach the caller, because the code removes it after the model is finished.

Matching is by literal value, not by equivalent value. A tool that returns `0.646` does not license the
reply "64.6%": that is arithmetic the tool did not do, and the assistant must quote a measurement the way
the ledger's own renderer forms it. The cost of this rule is an occasional stripped sentence that was in
fact true; the cost of the looser rule is a number the ledger never contained, which is the failure this
whole module exists to prevent.

`complete` is injected rather than constructed, because a tool-calling loop whose only test is "does it
reach the GPU" is untested. The default adapter talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
(`PRAVRUDHI_CHAT_ENDPOINT`, defaulting to the proposer's local llama.cpp), and asks for a JSON draft rather
than using the native tools API, which llama.cpp does not implement.
