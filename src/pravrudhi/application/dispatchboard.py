"""The swarm page reported and could not act.

`application/swarm.py` and `application/subagents.py` already dispatch delegated work safely and route it by
measured outcome, but only from a compiled objective plan. Nothing let an operator hand the swarm an ad hoc brief
and watch it run: "where are the tools, skills, plugins, multi-agent orchestration", and the swarm page rendered
routing rows with no control that dispatched anything. This module is that control's backing store and driver.

A `Job` is one ad hoc brief, queued as a plain JSON file under `.pravrudhi/jobs/` so a read route can list it
without a server that has been running since submission. `submit` refuses a job outright rather than queue
something that could never be dispatched safely: no declared allowed paths, or a path that reaches outside the
workspace. `run_next` takes the oldest queued job, narrows it to a named sandbox policy exactly as
`application/sandbox_policy.py` already does for compiled plans, and dispatches it through the same swarm
machinery `application/subagents.py` uses -- the router when no agent is pinned, `delegate.dispatch` directly
when one is. The dispatch itself runs in a background thread so the caller (an API request) returns immediately;
`max_concurrent` and `max_queued`, read from the packaged `dispatch.yaml`, keep a burst of submissions from
starting more agent processes than the machine can sustain or queuing more than an operator can review.

Nothing here writes to the ledger, `research/`, `gates/` or `pravrudhi_kernel/`: a job's `allowed_paths` are
whatever the caller declares, narrowed by the sandbox policy exactly as any other dispatched task, and a job's
outcome is operational state beside the workspace's other run logs, never evidence.
