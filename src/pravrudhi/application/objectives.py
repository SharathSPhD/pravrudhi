"""Objectives: what the user is trying to achieve, and whether it is happening.

Until this module existed the engine improved things the engine had chosen. Both tracks were hard-wired — the model
track to GSM8K accuracy, the harness track to HumanEval+ pass@1 — so a user who wanted a legal-domain model had no
way to say so and no screen that answered whether it was working. "Improve against a benchmark" is an empty claim
when the benchmark was picked by whoever wrote the engine rather than by whoever wants the result.

An objective holds the intent verbatim, the track under which its evidence accumulates, the benchmarks that measure
it, the recipes it may draw on, and optionally a target. Progress is never stored: it is recomputed from the
ledger's external-eval rows every time it is asked for, so a number on the objective screen is a number the ledger
contains. Three states are kept distinguishable rather than collapsed to zero — no baseline, baseline only, and
measured — because a screen that renders "no data" as 0.0 tells the user the loop failed when in fact it has not
yet run.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-pravrudhi-objectives-design.md.
