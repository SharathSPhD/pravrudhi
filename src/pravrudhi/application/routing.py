"""Choosing which agent and model does a piece of delegated work, from measured outcomes rather than from taste.

The routing table used to be four hardcoded pairs. Two of the four were wrong, and neither error was visible until
someone looked at a bill. The mechanical tier pointed at a local open-weight model that produced no change at all
on two tasks a hosted agent finished in minutes. The standard tier passed no model at all, which takes the agent's
default, and on this account the default is the most expensive model available -- so three of the four tiers were
quietly paying the top rate. Twenty sessions in one day cost seven million input tokens, nearly all of it on work
that did not need that model.

A hardcoded table cannot notice either mistake, because it records a belief and never a result. This module records
results. Every dispatch appends an outcome -- tier, route, accepted or not, how long it took -- to a routing log,
and the next choice is made from those outcomes: among the routes permitted at a tier, take the cheapest whose
success rate is not distinguishably worse than the best route's, using the same Wilson interval the rest of the
engine uses for a proportion. Below a declared minimum number of trials a route has no record, and the declared
order decides.

Two boundaries matter and are enforced rather than assumed.

The routing log is not the ledger. It records what this engine spent on its own upkeep, not what any experiment
measured, so it carries no pramana tag, it is not replayed, and no evidence document may cite it. It lives beside
the workspace's other operational state.

The router never widens a route's permissions. A route serves the tiers its configuration names and no others, so
the router cannot decide to try the cheapest model on the most critical work because the cheap one has been lucky.
Promoting a route to a harder tier is a human edit to `configs/routing.yaml`.

    route on evidence that could not distinguish them.
