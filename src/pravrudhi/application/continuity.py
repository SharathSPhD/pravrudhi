"""What happened when the work had to move -- between agents, between sessions, or off a model that hit its limit.

A heartbeat (`application/heartbeat.py`) records what it did on its own schedule; `application/subagents.py`
records what one dispatched step produced; `application/routing.py` records which route a tier chose. None of
those logs answers "who was doing this, what did they get through, and what is still open" when a session ends
mid-task and a different agent -- or the same one, later -- has to pick it back up. This module is that record: a
running log of continuity events, and a brief compiled from it plus the engine's own declared state, addressed to
whoever reads it next rather than to a gate or a ledger reviewer.

Nothing here writes to the ledger, `research/`, `gates/` or `pravrudhi_kernel/`. The continuity log is operational
state beside the workspace's other logs, not evidence.
