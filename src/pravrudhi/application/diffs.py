"""Every competitor surveyed leads with a diff viewer. This engine dispatches a swarm whose entire output is
diffs, and until now had no way to look at one.

A dispatched task's work lives in its own git worktree (see `agents/base.py`'s `GitWorktreeMixin`, which
`delegate.py` and `dispatchboard.py` both use): `.worktrees/agent-<task_id>` on branch `agent/<task_id>`,
created off whatever commit was `HEAD` in the main checkout at dispatch time. That commit -- recovered here as
the merge-base between the worktree's `HEAD` and the main checkout's current `HEAD` -- is the worktree's base:
`git diff <base>` against the worktree's working tree shows everything the task has done, committed or not,
without needing to know a branch name or trust that nothing was rebased.

Nothing here writes anything. `worktree_diff` only ever runs `git rev-parse`, `git merge-base`, `git diff` and
`git ls-files`, scoped to a path this module has itself verified sits under `<root>/.worktrees/`, so a hostile
task id can neither escape the worktree directory nor invoke anything but git.
