"""`pravrudhi app`: the product, served locally by the engine.

One process, one port. The engine's API and the built web app are served together, so a user runs a single command
and opens a browser; there is no account, no cloud and no second service to start. The same frontend build is what
the hosted site deploys, pointed at a demo backend instead of this one, so the local app and the public app cannot
drift apart.

Route order matters: the API is registered first, the static frontend is mounted last as a catch-all, and any
client-side route (a browser refresh on /runs) falls back to index.html the way a static export expects.

    directory, looks for an `index.html` inside it, does not find one, and (because `html=True` and the export also
    ships a `404.html`) answers 404. Every route but `/` was therefore either a 404 or the home page when the engine
    served the interface itself. The public site did not show this because Vercel does the `.html` mapping for you.
