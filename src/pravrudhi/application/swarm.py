"""Running several agents at once, continuously, without them colliding or overspending.

Delegation handles one task safely. A swarm is the same guarantees applied to many tasks in parallel, plus the
question delegation does not answer: which agent and which model should take this piece of work?

Routing is by tier, and the tiers are about difficulty rather than importance. Mechanical work goes to an
open-weight model on hardware already paid for; ordinary build work goes to a fast hosted agent; design work goes
to a stronger one; and the most capable model is reserved for the few tasks where being wrong is expensive, because
using it everywhere would be waste rather than diligence. A tier is a claim about the work, so it is recorded with
the result and can be argued with afterwards.

Parallelism is bounded by disjoint ownership rather than by a worker count: tasks run together only when their
declared paths cannot collide, which is checked before anything is dispatched rather than discovered in a merge.

# Two corrections, both from measurement rather than from taste.
#
# The mechanical tier used to route to a local open-weight model. It produced no change at all, twice, on tasks a
# hosted agent completed in minutes. Serving text and driving an agentic tool-calling loop are different
# capabilities, and a 1.7B model has the first and not the second. The tier now routes to the cheapest hosted
# model instead, and local models are used for what they are good at.
#
# The standard tier used to pass model=None, which takes the agent's default. On this account that default is the
# most expensive model available, so three of the four tiers were silently spending the top rate: twenty sessions
# in one day consumed seven million input tokens, nearly all of it on work that did not need that model. Naming a
# model explicitly at every tier is the fix, and the top model is now reserved for the tier that says critical.
