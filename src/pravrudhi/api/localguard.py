"""Protecting a local engine from the browser the user is also using.

`pravrudhi app` runs an unauthenticated API on localhost that can start GPU work. That combination is the classic
setup for cross-site request forgery: any page a user visits while the engine is running can issue requests to
127.0.0.1, and if the engine answers them the page can start runs, stop runs, or read the user's results. Being
bound to loopback prevents nothing here, because the attacker's code runs inside the user's own browser.

Three defences, each covering what the others do not.

Cross-origin requests are refused by default. The API sends no permissive CORS headers unless the operator names
the origins, so a malicious page cannot read a response even when it can send a request.

The Host header must name a loopback address. Refusing anything else defeats DNS rebinding, where an attacker's
domain resolves to 127.0.0.1 so that the browser believes the request is same-origin.

State-changing requests carry a token. The token is generated on first use, stored readable only by the user, and
served only to a same-origin caller, so a page that can still reach the engine cannot start a run without it. Read
endpoints stay open, because a local dashboard should work without ceremony and reading is not the risk.
