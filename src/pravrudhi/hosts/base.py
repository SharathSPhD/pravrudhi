"""Machines Pravrudhi can place work on.

Pravrudhi is the recursive self-improvement engine; a fleet of machines is something it *uses*, never something it
becomes. So the fleet layer is deliberately small and owned here: a host is a name, a transport and a set of
measured capabilities, and placement is a function from a job's requirements to a host that satisfies them.

Three rules keep this from diluting the engine. A single machine with no configuration is the default, because the
engine must stay a thing a stranger can download and run. Transports are interchangeable, so no orchestrator is
load-bearing: Orca is one transport beside local execution and plain SSH. And capabilities are *measured on the
host*, never declared in a config file, because a config that claims a GPU it does not have would put real
evidence on the wrong machine.
