"""Running a candidate `solve(stdin) -> str` against APPS stdin/stdout pairs, one disposable interpreter per pair.

MBPP+ never needed this: EvalPlus ships the tests and its own guarded executor, so the scorer could hand it a
solution and a task id. APPS ships raw input/output strings and nothing runnable, so the obvious implementation
is to `exec` the candidate in the scorer process — and the first `while True:` a model writes then hangs the
scorer until the kernel's job timeout kills it, which discards the scores of every other item in the rotation
and admits a whole paired evaluation of zeros for a reason no ledger row would show. Each pair therefore runs in
its own interpreter with its own timeout, so a hang costs exactly one test.

Pure stdlib and no torch: importable and testable outside the container.
